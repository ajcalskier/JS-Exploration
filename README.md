# JS-Exploration
An easy place to send and track various personal explorations in JavaScript

I want to use this to store anything I may have related to learning JS, regardless of course. 

1st June 2017

For instance if I start reading a JS book, take part in a game that involves/requires JS or just need some place to store a file(s) for later retrieval. 
It will probably be very unorganized.

I only just started using the Android app "Enki" but I must say is very impressive.
