# JS-Exploration
An easy place to send and track various personal explorations in JavaScript

I want to use this to store anything I may have related to learning JS, regardless of course.

For instance if I start reading a JS book, take part in a game that involves/requires JS or just need some place to store a file(s) for later retrieval. 
It will probably be very unorganized.

I only just started using the Android app "Enki" but I must say is very impressive.

Since it's been 18 months i guess I'm not going to be doing the youtube thing above.

I decded maybe I would follow some of the courses I bought from udemy. I mean I bought enough courses I could try actually doing the courses.

I'm doing this if this is of interest to anybody:
