I made it through part 5 of that udemy course which is completion of the breakout game.

I figured I'd break a little bit and try to even more understand the underlying code for the game before continuuing. 

I'm think of trying "100 days of code" since I've already got 4 or 5 days in row anyway.

Maybe I'll try my own version of breakout. Or some variation using the contents from "The Coding Train". That could be a thing.

Since it's been 18 months i guess I'm not going to be doing the youtube thing above.

I decded maybe I would follow some of the courses I bought from udemy. I mean I bought enough courses I could try actually doing the courses.



An easy place to send and track various personal explorations in JavaScript

I want to use this to store anything I may have related to learning JS, regardless of course.

For instance if I start reading a JS book, take part in a game that involves/requires JS or just need some place to store a file(s) for later retrieval. 
It will probably be very unorganized.

I only just started using the Android app "Enki" but I must say is very impressive.
